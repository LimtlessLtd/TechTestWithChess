# TechTestWithChess

Pick a chess piece with a defined set of moves available to it,
the app will then loop through every starting position on the phonepad,
and map out all possible moves up to 7 in a  row.

We then flatten and loop through the map,
looking for any results that meet the criteria set out in the question.
